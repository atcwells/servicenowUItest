# ServiceNow Build Tool

##A tool for compiling TypeScript projects to ServiceNow Script Includes

This tool will take a bunch of TypeScript files, compile them, mash all javascript into a single string and uglify it. The resulting code can be imported into a ServiceNow Script Include for use elsewhere in the system. All methods exposed by the main entry point of your TypeScript application will be exposed to the ServiceNow execution context.

###Jobs:

1. **Compile**
The tool starts by running tsc (TypeScript compiler) against all available '.ts' files.

2. **Browserify**
The tool will take the single file specified in the package.json as 'main', and produce a public function for each method provided. This becomes the available API within ServiceNow

3. **Fix block scoping issue**
ServiceNow has a specific issue where it doesn't hoist a function properly under certain circumstances, so we simply have to replace 'function e(...' with 'e = function(...' in the code. _Not your code, it's the functions Browserify creates that cause the problem. Your code is not modified._

4. **Uglify**
We run this job just to compress everything into the smallest space. The result will be placed in the './dist/deploy.js' file.

5. **Clean**
Finally we clean up all the compiled '.js' files.

###Setup:

1. Run the following at the command prompt:
  `npm install -save servicenowify`

1. Add the following to the 'scripts' section of your package.json:
```json
  "build": "build_servicenow_server"
```

1. Run the following at the command prompt:
  `npm run build`

###Options:
To configure the buildtool, a section should be added to your package.json like this:

```json
   "servicenowify": {
     "name": "OPSD_DBScan",
     "sourcedir": "/server",
     "distdir": "/dist",
     "distfile": "deploy.js",
     "jobs": [
       "compile",
       "browserify",
       "fix_block_scoping",
       "uglify",
       "clean"
     ]
   }
```

###Available Jobs:

1. **compile**

1. **browserify**

1. **fix_block_scoping**

1. **uglify**

1. **clean**

###Questions:

1. **Is it possible to specify the build order, or the jobs run?**
   This project was built to support a certain build team. If you'd like different choices, you'll need to fork the project, change the code and do it yourself, currently I can't support this.

1. **What about a JavaScript project, rather than TypeScript?**
   See 1. It would not be hard to edit the 'build_server.js' file to just have the jobs you want, until I implement the ability to specify build jobs.
